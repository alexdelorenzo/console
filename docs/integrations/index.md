# Integrations
Serverless Console has a growing list of supported integrations,
which include cloud providers such as [AWS Lambda](./aws/), as well as
communication and collaboration tools such as Github, and Slack.

This section provides an overview of our currently supported integrations.

## AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is the first supported integrations. It can be configured
through [Serverless Framework](../index.md) or [manually](./aws/index.md#configuring-the-serverles-console-extension)
